Serves 4
*Ingredients:*
* 4 tablespoons of bourbon 
* 1 tablespoon of maple syrup
* 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar
* 2 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1 12-ounce block of firm tofu, drained and cubed 
* Cornstarch for coating 
* Neutral oil
* Salt and pepper to taste

*Directions:*

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the bourbon, maple syrup, apple cider vinegar and minced garlic. Season with salt and pepper to taste. After draining the tofu (I like to do this by placing the block of tofu on a stack of paper towels and pressing it down with a weighted cast iron skillet), cube it and place it into the marinade. Allow it to sit for at least an hour in the refrigerator. 
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Fill another bowl with enough cornstarch to coat the tofu. Remove the tofu from the marinade, and douse it in the cornstarch. Place the tofu cubes on a sheet pan drizzled with neutral oil.
